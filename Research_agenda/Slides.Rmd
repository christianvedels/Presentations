## Why This Journey & Where It's heading

1. **Motivation**  
   - Can we improve life quality substantially? How?  
   – What Denmark’s micro-experiments teach about economic development

2. **Five grand puzzles**  
   *Geography • Institutions • Culture • Persistence • Welfare*

3. **Evidence toolbox**  
   Causal inference | GIS & archival data | Machine-learning tools

4. **Case studies**  
   - Limfjord storm & market access  
   - Railways $\rightarrow$ civic movements  
   - Energy shocks & adaptability  
   - Cooperatives, conflict & productivity  

5. **Looking ahead**  
   New datasets (CHAOS, Occunyms) & unanswered questions

### From Rome to Economic History  

- **Spark moment – Rome, study trip, 2012**  
  *Realised a city can outlive generations; wanted to know the forces behind such endurance.*

- **Dual fascination**  
  *Blend of "hard" (quantitative) and "soft" (historical-institutional) sciences.*

- **Research lens**  
  *Causal inference × Geography × Institutions & Culture*  
  - How shocks (natural, social, technological) redirect long-run development.

## How to improve the world?

### 'Easy' answer
- Go into politics

### 'Hard' answer
- Do research and learn something about it
- (And learn that you cannot generally improve things)

"Adaptability, diversification, and energy shocks: A firm level productivity analysis"

- Because of WWI and the Spanish Flu, Coal imports from England were strained
- Some creameries were located closer to an (inferior but available) alternative: Peat
- Short run and long run benefits

### Process reflection
- Started off in another PhD students project - needed help with the econometrics
- Working paper out in 2021
- Was rejected approx 4-5 different journals
- Finally decided to fix up weird econometrics

Submitted to the AER `r as.numeric(Sys.Date() - as.Date("2025-05-20"))` days ago (fingers cross for reports with the rejection)  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00885
]

- How much of the location of prosperity is determined by first-nature geography?
- In 1825 an unexpected storm completely altered the first-nature characteristics of North Western Denmark
- 25% population growth within a generation + fertility + manufacturing

### Process reflection
- Stumbled on the idea on vacation
- The struggle was with framing it in the literature
- When should you prioritize your own stuff?

- An important economic activity is work
- Historical sources are ripe with information of peoples' occupation but it needs to be standardized
- We train a language model on ~20 million observations spanning 13 different language from 29 different sources
- Open source, user friendly, fast and highly accurate


### Process reflection

## CHAOS: Converting Historical Accounts into Occupational Scores
.small123[
w. Matt Curtis, Torben Johansen, Julius Koschnick
]

.pull-left[
.small123[
- Your job is a useful proxy of your (expected) income
- Common setup in history: 
  + Source: Some agency noted average wages for certain occupations
  + In the censuses we now what job people had
- Can we infer their level of income (already done) flexibly and automatically using the most relevant *local* sources + skill, education, etc. (contribution)
- Trick: It's all based on probabilities of *OccCANINE*

### Process reflection
- Presented this summer 
- Let's see how it goes
- 'Residual' time project
